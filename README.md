It's a project that i've done with odin-project. first it was bare bone
just javascript code.i was supposed to upload that version here too. but it felt too stupid and easy to upload it to git. Then i learned DOM. And ...it's still dumb and stupid...but i've decided i should push it anyway so in future i can see from where i started. i'd have sort of a
timeline of what i0ve learned in various stages of this project.
